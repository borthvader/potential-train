## Description

This project was created with the purpose of practicing various JavaScript Elements including eventListeners, localStorage, and other function triggers. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I created a basic timed quiz to test a user's knowlege of some of the items I used to create this page. User will be prompted to answer questions and at the end will have the option to record thier highscore
